= Quarkus - Class Loading Reference

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This document explains the Quarkus class loading architecture. It is intended for extension
authors and advanced users who want to understand exactly how Quarkus works.

The Quarkus class loading architecture is slightly different depending on the mode that
the application is run in. When running a production application everything is loaded
in the system class loader, so it is a completely flat class path. This also applies to
native image mode which does not really support multiple class loaders, and is based on
a normal production Quarkus application.

For all other use cases (e.g. tests, dev mode, and building the application) Quarkus
uses the class loading architecture outlined here.
